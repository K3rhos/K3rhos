# About me

Hey it's K3rhos, I'm a C++ developer and reverse engineer in game modding since 2017, started by modding on GTA 5 (Still doing it on my free time), that made me love RE (Reverse Engineering) and C++.

I'm currently working on a huge multiplayer mod project on SRTTR (Saints Row The Third Remastered), this one is private but you can find repositories regarding this project that I make to help me in dev/reverse engineering.
