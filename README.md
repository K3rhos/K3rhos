Hey it's K3rhos, I'm a C++ developer and reverse engineer in game modding since 2017.

I'm actually working on a huge multiplayer mod project on SRTTR (Saints Row The Third Remastered), this one is private but you can find repositories regarding this project that I make to help me in dev/reverse engineering.
