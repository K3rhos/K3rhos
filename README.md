# About me

Hey it's K3rhos, I'm a C++ developer and reverse engineer in game modding since 2017, started by modding on GTA 5 (Still doing it on my free time), that made me love RE (Reverse Engineering) and C++.

I was working on a huge mod project on SRTTR (Saints Row The Third Remastered) from 2021 to 2023, which was consisting of developing a multiplayer for this game. But sadly due to lack of interest and support from the community, but I thanks every ppls that were following this project, I'm going to put this project in the background for now !
I will probably come back sometimes to work on it, but it's not my main project anymore !

I'm now developing a game, called "Bribe Authorities" (subject to change), it's a GTA Like multiplayer type of game in the PS2 era graphics style with dedicated servers, including exclusive minigames and with a huge amount of enterable interiors.

More news will come later this year about this project.
